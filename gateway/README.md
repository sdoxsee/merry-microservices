Merry Microservices - UI Gateway

This is a simple CRUD front-end gateway application with Create React App, TypeScript, and Hooks. The JavaScript is served up by Spring Cloud Gateway--acting as a light server-side proxy for the React UI that safely manages OpenID Connect and OAuth2 flows and that relays request back to our note resources server.
